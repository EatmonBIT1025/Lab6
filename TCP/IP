a.  It is basically a network protocol that defines the details of how data is sent and received through network adapters, hubs, switches, routers and other network communications hardware.
b. The “Client” in a TCP/IP connection is the computer or device that “dials the phone” and the “Server” is the computer that is “listening” for calls to come in. In other words, the Client
needs to know the IP Address of whatever Server it wants to connect to and it also needs to know the port number that it wants to send and receive data through after a connection has been established.

i. It is possible to write a single protocol that takes data from one computer application and sends it to an application on another computer.- A Single stack Protocol The problem with this approach is that it very inflexible, as any changes require changing the entire application and protocol software.
The approach used in networking is to create layered protocol stacks. Each level of the stack performs a particular function and communicates with the levels above and below it.
ii. SMTP, FTP, HTTP, POP3, IMAP4, SNMP
